The two main plagues ofi mage restoration are oscillations
and smoothing. Traditional image restoration techniques
prevent parasitic oscillations by resorting to smooth regularization.
Hence, singular image features and oscillatory
textures cannot be restored. The usefulness of images obtained
by smooth regularization is very limited. Regularized
faces and characters lose features and are unrecognizably
distorted. Oscillatory patterns and textures are not
allowed by regularization methods. Smoothly regularized
images are of no use in criminal/civil investigations and as
court evidence.
